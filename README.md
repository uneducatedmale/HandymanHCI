The Problem and Challenges: Construction contractors and small construction businesses have to typically go through many different social media platforms in order to reach their client base.
This varies from phone calls, facebook, instagram, tiktok, and so on. This can create headache for both the contractor and the client since the contractor has to bounce around
to many different platforms, and clients might not even be sure which method of contact would be most effective.

The Solution: To make a custom platform specifically designed for contractors and for clients. For clients it would be an effective way to view and contact contractors with the
specific skill set they are looking for. For contractors it would be a great way to manage all their clients in one place and be far more efficient and organized.

What it will be: A web/mobile app

Target Population: (Primarily) Private Contractors, and people who need construction work done
