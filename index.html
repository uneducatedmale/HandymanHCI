  <h2>Connecting Homeowners and Contractors Seamlessly</h2>

  <!-- Project Introduction -->
  <p>
    The Handyman App is a human-centered platform designed to improve communication, project management,
    and contractor discovery within the home improvement industry. Homeowners often struggle to find
    reliable contractors, facing challenges related to trust, pricing transparency, and communication gaps.
    Meanwhile, independent contractors face logistical hurdles in managing their projects and maintaining
    client relationships efficiently.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our solution addresses these pain points through a unified platform that allows homeowners to search
    and filter contractors based on skills, location, price, and reviews. Contractors benefit from
    centralized project management tools, real-time messaging, and availability tracking features to
    better coordinate their workload. Built with human-centered design principles, the Handyman App
    emphasizes usability, trust-building, and accessibility for users across different experience levels.

    This website documents our full design process, including user research, prototyping, evaluation,
    and final refinement based on usability feedback. Explore the different sections to see how we
    developed the Handyman App from concept to high-fidelity prototype.
